This is the final project work for ga-ds-2018

High level lessons learned:
* Random forest was absolutely new to me at the last week of the project in 2018 -- there are many more options now for Decision Trees like XGBoost 
* New to Python outside of script kitty-ing this was what I could get done without crashing the notebook in 2018 
* Beautiful AI pdf and ppt print black on paper, but present fine (way before Google AI in 2022 that could make better docs/presentation :D )
